>_The Woocommerce plugin is not restrictive_. You don't need it plugin to use this plugin.

### **Secure**
#### Restriction on server side.
This plugin **doesn't just disable the email field** on the view using JavaScript. The logic is on server side. 

In case that a techy user modify the html template using an inspector element to remove the disable attribute on the email filed to modify it, when he submits the form, the server will not allow it.
